## Welcome

This is the homepage of the Autodrift Grand Prix NUS competition!

### Introduction

The Autodrift Grand Prix NUS is a competition for computer science and computer engineering students. It provides them with an exciting challenge to hone their skills in machine learning. The participating teams compete in programming a drift racing model car to complete a race track autonomously. The teams are provided with stock hardware and the winner is the autonomous drift driving algorithm that completes the track the fastest.

### Video Demo
The following video demonstrates a possible approach achieved with the use of Deep Learning.
