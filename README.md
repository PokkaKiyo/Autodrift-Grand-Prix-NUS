## Welcome

This is the homepage of the Autodrift Grand Prix NUS competition!

### Introduction

The Autodrift Grand Prix NUS is a competition targeted towards NUS School of Computing students.
It aims to provide competitors with an experiential learning experience: teams will compete in programming a Remote Controlled car to not only complete a race track autonomously, but also to allow the car to perform drifting. Teams will be provided with the stock hardware to achieve this, and need only upload their algorithms.

### Video Demos
The following videos demonstrate a possible approach achieved with the use of Machine Learning.
